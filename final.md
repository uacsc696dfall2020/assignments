## Project Final Presentation

Version History: 

- Released, 2020/011/22

Due Thursday December 3rd at 9:00 AM

In this exercise we are:

- Practicing presenting a project to a broader audience
- Discussing what was learned during our projects

Create a repository for the presentation at this Github Classroom link [https://classroom.github.com/a/mDFMBwmD](https://classroom.github.com/a/mDFMBwmD).

At the time of submission, this repository should include a PDF version of
your presentation slides. You are allowed to use video, animations, and
demonstrations in your actual presentation, but for the Github submission, a
placeholder should be used (e.g., URL, screenshot).




#### Presentation


You will prepare a 20-25 minute (without interruption) presentation on your
project.

The goal of this presentation is to present an overview of your project with
an emphasis on what was learned. What was learned should include both what you
learned regarding your research questions and what you learned about
conducting research that involves human participants.

Therefore, your presentation should include the following:

- Just enough background information for the class to understand your project.
  Notice how it says "just enough". The idea is to help people understand,
not to prove your own depth in the subject matter. Here are some topics to consider:
  - domain-specific background
  - related work
  - overview of a technique or methodology if we haven't discussed it before
  - if you are evaluating a visualization or tool, some explanation, pictures,
    and/or movies of that software
  - **Tip:** Consider carefully whether the audience needs certain details to
    understand the rest of your presentation. Sometimes those unnecessary
details add to the interest/engagement, but other times they may confuse the
audience, especially if presented as dry bullet points. If they illustrate a
concept, then they are not unnecessary.
- Your research question and motivation for why it is important to answer it
- What you did in your project in sufficient detail for the class to
  understand and assess.
  - Your procedures, both in data collection and analysis
  - Tasks and specific data if applicable.
  - The rationale for the choices you made.
- A sketch of the work you plan to do for PM5 if not already done.
- Your conclusions thus far. (What you've learned regarding your research
  question.)
- The limitations to your conclusions.
- What you learned about conducting this type of research and what
  recommendations you would like to have given yourself at the beginning of
the semester (or another person in your position). 

You should be prepared to answer questions about any details not covered and
respond to suggestions in a thoughtful manner. You may need to ask the person
making the suggestion follow up questions to understand their suggestion.

You are not required to follow any suggestion, just consider it. 

Your presentation will be graded on:

* (35 pts) the inclusion of the content described
* (20 pts) the effectiveness and clarity of conveying that information
* (20 pts) the use of visual aids and spoken word.
* (15 pts) the structure and flow of the presentation: Do the topics change
  naturally or is it disjointed? Do you know what you are going to say or do
you halt and/or read off the slides? Do you speak at a reasonable pace?

Your presentation and the included slides will be assessed.

If you are unable to present live, you must: 

1. Upload a recording of your presentation somewhere accessible by the
   students and instructor 24 hours in advance, such as Youtube or Google
Drive. Email the instructor with the link. You may use a private link, **but**
note the instructor does not have an `email.arizona.edu` Google account, so
you may not limit Google Drive uploads to that domain. 

2. Handle the questions and discussion online in a discussion thread on
   Piazza over the 36 hours following your presentation.



#### Participation (10 pts)

You are expected to be active in the discussion of each presentation. You will
be assessed on your participation (10 pts) during the presentations.

If you are unable to attend the synchronous discussion, you must watch the
recording of the presentation and subsequent discussion. Then, go to the
thread regarding the presentation and make at least one novel suggestion and
respond to two suggestions made during the recording. You may also ask
quesitons, clarifying or otherwise, to help your response. You must also
complete the associated quiz.
