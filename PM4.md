## Project Milestone 3

Version History: 

- Released, 2020/11/4


Due Thursday November 19, 11:59PM

In this milestone we are:

- Reporting on our progress with the project
- Creating artifacts of our progress on the project, e.g., data 
- Assessing changes made since our previous milestone
- Correcting deficiencies in our previous milestones
- Getting more practice with LaTeX

Create a repository for this milestone at this following Github Classroom
link: [https://classroom.github.com/g/udOHH5XZ](https://classroom.github.com/g/udOHH5XZ).

All material you want graded should be in that folder at the deadline. All the
files needed to compile your document should be in that folder. There is a
geometric penalty associated with repeated failure to follow these
instructions. **NO Auxiliary files should be in that folder. Do not include
P43.pdf, PM4.aux, etc.** 

Continue to use the LaTeX files required to format an IEEE VGTC-style
document. Like in PM2 and PM3, I am not providing the rest of the files. You
will likely want to copy `PM3.tex` from last milestone and adapt it to
the requirements below.

There should be a `PM4.tex` file that compiles into a `PM4.pdf` file when I
type `make`.

Create a folder named `artifacts` in your repository. This folder should
include any auxiliary files for your project that are not otherwise
accessible or must be kept private, for example data.

Your PM4 report should include several sections described below. Also, see my
comments in Project Milestone 3 for any additional information I expect to see
in this milestone.

## Artifacts

Create a directory called `artifacts`. This should include materials created
and collected for your project, including but not limited to:


1. **Data**. Some of you may have collected preliminary data at this point. If possible
include that data along with a `README` explaining it in the artifacts
directory. This data may include interview notes, experimental data, coded
data, and the like. Think of this as if you were submitting a paper with best
practice open science.

**You should anonymize any participant data before including it.**

2. **Interview Questions, Surveys, Scripts**. Include materials to conduct
   your study such as briefing/de-briefing scripts, questions, surveys, task
lists, mock ups or screen shots of visualizations, other required images, and
any consent or recruitment forms if changed since last milestone.

3. **Interactive Artifacts**. If your project requires the use an interactive
   system, potentially written by you, include a brief movie showing the
current state of the system. Note Github has a size limitation, so you may
include a Youtube, Box, Dropbox, or Google Drive link. However, note that the
instructor does not have an `email.arizona.edu` GSuite account when setting
permissions.

## Report

Your PM4 report should include several sections:

#### Abstract

Briefly describe your project and contributions you have made for this
milestone.


#### Section: Overview

Create a top level section called `Overview`. In this section, describe the
overall goal of your project -- what overarching problem is it trying to help
solve (not necessarily a visualization problem) and then what is the
visualization aspect of that problem that your project entails. This should be
like the section you did for PM3, but updated with any changes made since the
last milestone. Please do not include the previous milestone's summaries, only
this one.

At the end of this section, summarize what work was completed for this milestone. 


#### Section: Study Progress

Create a top level section called `Study Progress`. In this section,
describe what progress has been made. Such progress may include (1) new
artifacts created since last milestone -- programmed, written, or otherwise,
(2) design changes made based on what was learned since PM3,
(3) data collected and/or experimental procedures conducted, and (4) analysis
of collected data. Basically, everything you've done towards this project not
covered in another section goes here.

**By this point I expect you to be interacting with people (e.g. interviews,
observations, pilot studies depending on your project).** If you cannot or
have not, justify why and state the work that has been done instead.

In your descriptions, you may refer to the artifacts to help explain the
progress.  If you progress includes visualizations or partially done
visualizations, use figures **and** the movie (for interactive visualizations)
to describe and demonstrate the progress made. Describe the technologies
(e.g., languages, libraries, platforms) used to support your progress.

You may discuss proof of concept work, for example: code that will not be part
of your final project, but demonstrate that some technical piece of your
project will work.  For example, if you plan to rely on a third party library,
it could be a short script demonstrating that library works. 

If you collected data for the visualization to display (e.g., data for
experimental trials, case studies), please describe your data collection
efforts here. What did you do to collect the data? Is there still more that
you have to do? Data collected to support the task abstraction or design
should be described in those respective sections.



#### Section: Artifact Overview

Create a top level section called `Artifact Overview` and summarize the
contents of the artifacts directory. 


#### Section: Refinement from Previous Milestone

Create a top level section called `Refinement from Previous Milestones`. If
you were told to refine any subsection of the previous milestone, included the
refined version of that section as a subsection here. If you were not told to
refine any section, simply write `None requested.` 

**You only need to refine what is listed next to "Refinements needed for
PM4."** 


#### Section: Schedule

Create a top level section called `Schedule`. In this section, describe what
parts of your proposed PM4 goals have been met. Then describe which goals were
not met and an explanation of what choices or unexpected challenges led them
not to be met.

Describe what work will be done for the next two milestones, in light of
what was done for this milestone.
