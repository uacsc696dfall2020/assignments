This assignment is due Thursday September 3, 23:59


In this assignment we are:

- Demonstrating the assignment workflow for CSC 544
- Certifying our knowledge of ethics in human subjects research by completing the CITI training course ascribed by UA

**Note**: If you are current with your CITI training at UA, you may skip to step 3, which is uploading your completion certificate through the github classroom repository. If not, follow the steps below.

1. Follow the instructions of the [UA Human Subjects Protection Program](https://rgw.arizona.edu/compliance/human-subjects-protection-program/training-requirements) to create a CITI account and associate with UA.

2. Once inside the CITI website/system, complete the training course for Social & Behavioral Research Investigators. At the end, you should receive a PDF completion certificate.

3. Use the following link to create your github repository: [https://classroom.github.com/a/cmnt5xlu](https://classroom.github.com/a/cmnt5xlu). 

4. Commit your CITI completion certificate to the repository you created. Make sure it is visible through the repository hosted by github, not just a local copy of the repository.

You will be graded on what is in your github classroom repository associated with the assignment at the time of the due date. **Do Not forget to push your local copy of the repository to github.**
