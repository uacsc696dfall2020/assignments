## Project Milestone 3

Version History: 

- Released, 2020/10/14


Due Thursday October 29, 11:59PM

In this milestone we are:

- Reporting on our progress with the project
- Creating artifacts of our progress on the project, e.g., data 
- Assessing changes made since our previous milestone
- Correcting deficiencies in our previous milestones
- Getting more practice with LaTeX

Create a repository for this milestone at this following Github Classroom
link: [https://classroom.github.com/g/e8QBTtP4](https://classroom.github.com/g/e8QBTtP4).

All material you want graded should be in that folder at the deadline. All the
files needed to compile your document should be in that folder. There is a
geometric penalty associated with repeated failure to follow these
instructions. **NO Auxilliary files should be in that folder. Do not include
PM3.pdf, PM3.aux, etc.** 

Continue to use the LaTeX files required to format an IEEE VGTC-style
document. Like in PM2, I am not providing the rest of the files. You
will likely want to copy `PM2.tex` from last milestone and adapt it to
the requirements below.

There should be a `PM3.tex` file that compiles into a `PM3.pdf` file when I
type `make`.

Create a folder named `artifacts`` in your repository. This folder should
include any auxiliary files for your project that are not otherwise
accessible or must be kept private, forr example data.

Your PM3 report should include several sections described below. Also, see my
comments in Project Milestone 2 for any additional information I expect to see
in this milestone.

## Artifacts

Create a directory called `artifacts`. This should include materials created
and collected for yourr project, including but not limited to:


1. **Data**. Some of you may have collected preliminary data at this point. If possible.
include that data along with a `README` explaining it in the artifacts
directory. This data may include interview notes, experrimental data, coded
data, and the like. Think of this as if you were submitting a paper with best
practice open science.

**You should anonymize any participant data before including it.**

2. **Interview Questions, Surveys, Scripts**. Include materials to conduct
   your study such as briefing/de-briefing scripts, questions, surveys, task
lists, mock ups or screen shots of visualizations, other requiredd images, and
any consent or recruitment forms if changed since last milestone.

3. **Interactive Artifacts**. If your project requires the use an interactive
   system, potentially written by you, include a brief movie showing the
current state of the system. Note Github has a size limitation, so you may
include a Youtube, Box, Dropbox, or Google Drive link. However, note that the
instructor does ont have an `email.arizona.edu` GSuite account when setting
permissions.

## Report

Your PM3 report should include several sections:

#### Abstract

Briefly describe your project and contributions you have made for this
miletsone.


#### Section: Overview

Create a top level section called `Overview`. In this section, describe the
overall goal of your project -- what overarching problem is it trying to help
solve (not necessarily a visualization problem) and then what is the
visualization aspect of that problem that your project entails. This should be
like the section you did for PM2, but updated with any changes made since the
last milestone.

At the end of this section, summarize what work was completed for this milestone. 


#### Section: Design Changes & Feedback Response

Create a top level section callled `Design Changes & Feedback Response`. In
this section, describe any changes you've made to your planned project design
since last milestone along with your rationale for these changes. For example,
certain plans could be less feasible than originally expeccted or you may want
to incorporate feedback fromm the presentation.

Also in this section address any feedback you received but did not act upon
and your rationale for planning not to include it.



#### Section: Study Progress

Create a top level section called `Study Progress`. In this section,
describe what progress has been made. Such progress may include (1) new
artifacts created since last milestone -- programmed, written, or otherwise,
(2) data collected and/or experimmental procedures conducted, and (3) analysis
of collected data. Basically, everything you've done towards this project not
covered in another section goes here.

In your descriptions, you may refer to the artifacts to help explain the
progress.  If you progress includes visualizations or partially done
visualizations, use figures **and** the movie to describe and demonstrate the
progress made. Describe the technologies (e.g., languages, libraries,
platforms) used to support your progress.

You may discuss proof of concept work, for example: ode that will not be part
of your final project, but demonstrate that some technical piece of your
project will work.  For example, if you plan to rely on a third party library,
it could be a short script demonstrating that library works. 

If you collected data for the visualization to display (e.g., data for
experimental trials, case studies), please describe your data collection
efforts here. What did you do to collect the data? Is there still more that
you have to do? Data collected to support the task abstraction or design
should be described in those respective sections.



#### Section: Artifact Overview

Create a top level sectin calleld `Artifact Overview` and summarize the
contents of the artifacts directory. 


#### Section: Refinement from Previous Milestone

Create a top level section called `Refinement from Previous Milestones`. If
you were told to refine any subsection of the previous milestone, included the
refined version of that section as a subsection here. If you were not told to
refine any section, simply write `None requested.` 

**You only need to refine what is listed next to "Refinements needed for
PM3."** Help for how you may refine could be found in the 'Where you missed
points' sections. However, you do not need to refine every place you missed
points.


#### Section: Schedule

Create a top level section called `Schedule`. In this section, describe what
parts of your proposed PM3 goals have been met. Then describe which goals were
not met and an explanation of what choices or unexpected challenges led them
not to be met.

Describe what work will be done for the next two milestones, in light of
what was done for this milestone.
