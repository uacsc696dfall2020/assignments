## Project Milestone 2

Version History: 

- Released, 2020/9/16


Due Thursday October 8, 23:59

In this milestone we are:

- Reporting on our progress with the project
- Gaining experience with the ethical review process
- Assessing changes made since our first milestone
- Correcting deficiencies in our proposal
- Demonstrating we can adapt an existing LaTeX document to new specifications

Create a repository for this milestone at this following Github Classroom
link: [https://classroom.github.com/g/euhWtnUX](https://classroom.github.com/g/euhWtnUX).

In your repository on Github (**note just your local repository**) should be
all the files I need to build your PM2 when I type `make`. **DO NOT INCLUDE**
the pre-built `pm2.pdf`, any auxiliary files from the build (e.g., `pm2.aux`,
`pm2.log`, `pm2.bbl`), or any other files nnot needed to build the proposal
(e.g., `.DS_STORE`).

Continue to use the LaTeX files required to format an IEEE VGTC-style
document. However, this time I am not providing the rest of the files. You
will likely want to copy `proposal.tex` from last milestone and adapt it to
the requirements below.

There should be a `pm2.tex` file that compiles into a `pm2.pdf` file when I
type `make`. You will need to edit the `Makefile` to achieve this.

Additionally, there should be whatever documents are required for a draft IRB
proposal as described below.


### PM2 Report

Your PM2 report should include several sections:

#### Abstract

Briefly describe your project and contributions you have made for this
miletsone.


#### Section: Overview

Create a top level section called `Overview`. In this section, describe the
overall goal of your project -- what overarching problem is it trying to help
solve (not necessarily a human methods problem) and then what is the
human methods aspect of that problem that your project entails.

Then, summarize what work was completed for this milestone. 

#### Section: Related Work

Create a top level section called `Related Work`. Cite and describe existing
work related to your project, including but not limited to academic papers and
existing software (both open and closed source).

There are several ways in which work can be related beyond existing work that
is exactly what you propose to do. Consider other research that tries to solve
the overall question motivating your work but in a different way. Consider
visualization or other tools that try to solve a similar problem to yours.
Consider human participant studies that are similar in form but applied to a
different problem. You may want to look in the citations of the existing work
you already cited. 


#### Section: Study Design

Create a top level section called `Study Design`. In this section, describe
your plans for your study in text. It should go into detail regarding how
people will be recruited, exactly what they will be asked (including tasked to
do, any questions you will ask them (e.g., demographic information), what
artifacts you need to generate, how you plan to validate the design, and how
you plan to analyze the results. 

Note: You don't need to have already validated the design or the analysis.
That step will come in later milestones. This milestone is about having enough
detail in your design to perform such steps if required.

If you are doing a literature review, you do not need to talk about
recruitment and tasks, but you still need to to lay down your methodologies
for searching for literature and analyzing it.

Each part of your study design should be justified. In other words, you should
explain your rationale for each design decision, as well as potential trade
offs. You may cite similar studies or guidelines to help justify your choices.


You may also need the following to help explain your design:

* A "Domain Background" subsection to describe your specific problem area in enough
  detail that the study design makes sense. This can also be done as a top
level section before this one.

* A "Methodology Background" subsection to describe a methodology you are
  choosing to follow. For example, a
[recent paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.04058.pdf) using Grounded Theory
Methodology describes what it is in general before describing the paper's
particular application of it.

The goal is to write this section so anyone in class could understand it, not
just the instructor. While these sections are not required, consider using
them if they will help people understand your proposal.

#### Section: Refinement from Previous Milestone

Create a top level section called `Refinement from Previous Milestones`. If
you were told to refine any subsection of the previous milestone, included the
refined version of that section as a subsection here. If you were not told to
refine any section, simply write `None requested.`

These requests will be made through D2L by Thursday September 24th in the
grading field for PM1. 


#### Section: Changes & Schedule

Create a top level section called `Schedule`. In this section, describe what
has changed in your plans since PM1 (e.g., you may have a different design or
methodology than you had previously proposed). Explain briefly why you chose
to change plans.

Next, re-do your plans for the next three milestones in light of what you have
done in PM2. I am expecting a scheduling like the one in PM1, only updated to
reflect your more details and possibly changed plans.


### IRB Proposal

Create an IRB Proposal draft for your planned study design. If you are doing a
literature review, do the IRB Proposal draft for one of the human participant
studies in the topic of your literature review.

**DO NOT** submit your proposal draft to the IRB or to department review. **DO
NOT** email Dr. Kobus Barnard about this proposal. This is for class use and
educational purposes only.

I am expecting you to do Step 4 of the
[New IRB Project proposal process](https://rgw.arizona.edu/compliance/human-subjects-protection-program/getting-started)
and **ONLY Step 4**. Please omit the list of research
personnel and the CVs. Do include the [Application for Human Research](https://rgw.arizona.edu/compliance/human-subjects-protection-program/HSPP-form/forms-index) (and any applicable appendices on that page), Informed Consent Forms, and Recruitment Materials.

You do not need to include Data Collection Tools if you do not yet have them. 

If your study design is online (e.g., you cannot collect signatures), you may
need to include the Appendix for Alteration/Waivers of Consent. The other
appendices are self-explanatory.

Note you will probably need Acrobat Reader to complete the form.

Two example proposals are available under the `Resources` tab in Piazza.
Scroll down past the lecture slides to see them. Please download the
application form directly from the link above however as they frequently
update the form and only accept the latest copy.
