## Project In-Progress Presentation

Version History: 

- Revised, 2020/10/04 -- Feedback mechanism changed from D2L quiz to Google Forms
- Released, 2020/09/30

In this exercise we are:

- Practicing presenting a proposal to a broader audience
- Discussing the design of participant studies designed by this class
- Providing and receiving feedback on our projects


#### Presentation


You will prepare a 15-20 minute (without interruption) presentation on your
project.

**The goal of this presentation is to improve your project through discussion
and feedback with others.**

Therefore, your presentation should include the following:

- Just enough background information for the class to understand your project.
  Notice how it says "just enough". The idea is to help people understand,
not to prove your own depth in the subject matter. Here are some topics to consider:
  - domain-specific background
  - related work
  - overview of a technique or methodology if we haven't discussed it before
  - if you are evaluating a visualization or tool, some explanation, pictures,
    and/or movies of that software
- Your research question and motivation for why it is important to answer it
- The design of your project in sufficient detail for the class to provide
  meaningful feedback, including but not limited to:
  - Your measurement procedure.
  - Tasks and specific data if applicable.
  - Your analysis procedure. It should be more detailed than "I will use
    X test or Y method."
  - The rationale for each choice.
- The limitations you foresee.
- The possible problems you might have and how you plan to deal with those
  situations.

You should be prepared to answer questions about any details not covered and
respond to suggestions in a thoughtful manner. You may need to ask the person
making the suggestion follow up questions to understand their suggestion.

You are not required to follow any suggestion, just consider it. 

Your presentation will be graded on:

* (30 pts) the inclusion of the content described
* (15 pts) the effectiveness and clarity of conveying that information
* (20 pts) the use of visual aids and spoken word.
* (15 pts) the structure and flow of the presentation: Do the topics change
  naturally or is it disjointed? Do you know what you are going to say or do
you halt and/or read off the slides? Do you speak at a reasonable pace?


If you are unable to present live, you must: 

1. Upload a recording of your presentation somewhere accessible by the
   students and instructor 24 hours in advance, such as Youtube or Google
Drive. Email the instructor with the link. You may use a private link, **but**
note the instructor does not have an `email.arizona.edu` Google account, so
you may not limit Google Drive uploads to that domain. 

2. Handle the questions and discussion online in a discussion thread on
   Piazza over the 48 hours following your presentation.



#### Feedback & Participation (20 pts)

You are expected to be active in the discussion of each presentation. You will
be assessed on your participation (10 pts) during the presentations.

There will be a ~~quiz~~ Google Form (10 pts) for each presentation with two questions:

1. What do you think are the strengths of the research design.
2. What do you think can be improved about the research design.

Your answers will be shared with the presenter **without your name attached.**
The ~~quiz~~ form should be completed within 36 hours after the presentation. 

If you are unable to attend the synchronous discussion, you must watch the
recording of the presentation and subsequent discussion. Then, go to the
thread regarding the presentation and make at least one novel suggestion and
respond to two suggestions made during the recording. You may also ask
quesitons, clarifying or otherwise, to help your response. You must also
complete the associated quiz.
